              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              TextTrace began as a passion project by a group of textile artists who noticed the lack 
              of comprehensive, beginner-friendly resources for learning textile dyeing. We wanted to 
              create a platform that would bridge the gap between traditional craftsmanship and modern 
              learning methods.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              After years of teaching workshops and helping countless students discover the joy of 
              creating their own dyed fabrics, we realized that many people were eager to learn but 
              didn't know where to start. That's when we decided to build TextTrace â€“ a comprehensive 
              resource that would make textile dyeing education accessible to anyone with an internet 
              connection.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
              Today, we continue to grow our collection of recipes, techniques, and educational materials, 
              always with the goal of empowering more people to discover the transformative power of color.
